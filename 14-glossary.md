# Glossary
<!-- SECTION_REF: 14-glossary.s001 -->
Section Ref: `14-glossary.s001`

## Action
<!-- SECTION_REF: 14-glossary.s002 -->
Section Ref: `14-glossary.s002`

A player intent submitted to the engine, such as playing a card, declaring an attack, activating an effect, or responding to a pending decision.

## Atomic mutation
<!-- SECTION_REF: 14-glossary.s003 -->
Section Ref: `14-glossary.s003`

A single low-level state transition that emits one or more `EngineEvent`s and is followed by rule processing.

## Canonical state
<!-- SECTION_REF: 14-glossary.s004 -->
Section Ref: `14-glossary.s004`

The full server-only `GameState`, including hidden information and internal engine state.

## ComputedGameView
<!-- SECTION_REF: 14-glossary.s005 -->
Section Ref: `14-glossary.s005`

A derived view created by applying continuous effects, modifiers, and restrictions to base state. Used by the engine to answer questions such as current power or whether a card can attack.

## Continuous effect
<!-- SECTION_REF: 14-glossary.s006 -->
Section Ref: `14-glossary.s006`

An effect that modifies game values or permissions over a duration, such as power changes, keywords, restrictions, or protection.

## Decision
<!-- SECTION_REF: 14-glossary.s007 -->
Section Ref: `14-glossary.s007`

A pause in engine execution requiring player input. Examples: choose target, pay cost, activate optional trigger, order simultaneous triggers.

## Effect block
<!-- SECTION_REF: 14-glossary.s008 -->
Section Ref: `14-glossary.s008`

One distinct effect on a card, identified by a stable `effectId`.

## EngineEvent
<!-- SECTION_REF: 14-glossary.s009 -->
Section Ref: `14-glossary.s009`

A structured record emitted by atomic mutations. Trigger detection, replay logging, and debugging consume events.

## Full state
<!-- SECTION_REF: 14-glossary.s010 -->
Section Ref: `14-glossary.s010`

Same as canonical state. Must not be sent to a normal client.

## Hidden information
<!-- SECTION_REF: 14-glossary.s011 -->
Section Ref: `14-glossary.s011`

Game data a player is not entitled to know: opponent hand contents, deck order, face-down life, private search results, RNG seed, and internal engine state.

## PlayerView
<!-- SECTION_REF: 14-glossary.s012 -->
Section Ref: `14-glossary.s012`

A filtered view of game state for one player. Includes only that player's legal visible information.

## Replay drift
<!-- SECTION_REF: 14-glossary.s013 -->
Section Ref: `14-glossary.s013`

A mismatch between expected and actual state hashes when replaying a historical action log.

## Source presence policy
<!-- SECTION_REF: 14-glossary.s014 -->
Section Ref: `14-glossary.s014`

A rule on queued effects that determines whether the source card must still be in the original zone, can resolve from a destination zone, can use last-known information, or does not require a source.

## StateSeq
<!-- SECTION_REF: 14-glossary.s015 -->
Section Ref: `14-glossary.s015`

Monotonic sequence number for accepted state transitions visible to the server/client protocol.

## Support status
<!-- SECTION_REF: 14-glossary.s016 -->
Section Ref: `14-glossary.s016`

The implementation classification for a card: vanilla confirmed, implemented through DSL, implemented through custom handler, unsupported, or simulator-banned.

## View engine
<!-- SECTION_REF: 14-glossary.s017 -->
Section Ref: `14-glossary.s017`

Client-safe helper layer that operates only on filtered views and never on full state.

## Poneglyph terms
<!-- SECTION_REF: 14-glossary.s018 -->
Section Ref: `14-glossary.s018`

- **Poneglyph API** - external card-data service at `api.poneglyph.one`, used for printed card metadata, images, variants, and text.
- **Poneglyph base card ID** - canonical card identifier used in decks, engine state, effect definitions, and database rows.
- **Poneglyph variant index / variant key** - cosmetic alternate-art selector. Poneglyph payloads expose `variants[].index`; the simulator generates keys like `OP01-060:v0`. It affects display only and never changes gameplay.
- **Simulator overlay** - local data keyed by Poneglyph card ID that provides effect definitions, custom handlers, support status, rulings, and banlist data.


## Loadout
<!-- SECTION_REF: 14-glossary.s019 -->
Section Ref: `14-glossary.s019`

An account-level saved object containing a gameplay decklist plus cosmetic selections such as DON!! deck art, sleeves, playmat, icon, and card variants when image assets are available.

## PendingDecision
<!-- SECTION_REF: 14-glossary.s020 -->
Section Ref: `14-glossary.s020`

The canonical engine pause object representing any required player input, including trigger ordering, optional activations, target selection, card selection, and life-trigger confirmation.
