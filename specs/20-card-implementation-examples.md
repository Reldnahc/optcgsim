# Card Implementation Examples: OP01-060 and OP05-091
<!-- SECTION_REF: 20-card-implementation-examples.s001 -->
Section Ref: `20-card-implementation-examples.s001`

## Purpose
<!-- SECTION_REF: 20-card-implementation-examples.s002 -->
Section Ref: `20-card-implementation-examples.s002`

This file turns the supplied Poneglyph card examples into implementation guidance, DSL requirements, and acceptance tests. These two cards are useful because they expose several non-trivial engine needs:

- Poneglyph variant indexes are not simple positive IDs.
- FAQ entries can affect hidden-information behavior.
- Effects can temporarily reveal cards, then return them face-down.
- An effect can add a card to hand and then immediately allow that same card to be played.
- Card filters need name exclusion, type matching, color matching, category matching, and cost ranges.

## Example 1: OP01-060 Donquixote Doflamingo
<!-- SECTION_REF: 20-card-implementation-examples.s003 -->
Section Ref: `20-card-implementation-examples.s003`

### Poneglyph facts from fixture
<!-- SECTION_REF: 20-card-implementation-examples.s004 -->
Section Ref: `20-card-implementation-examples.s004`

```text
Card ID: OP01-060
Name: Donquixote Doflamingo
Category: Leader
Color: Blue
Power: 5000
Life: 5
Types: The Seven Warlords of the Sea; Donquixote Pirates
Effect: [DON!! x2] [When Attacking] ①: Reveal 1 card from the top of your deck. If that card is a {The Seven Warlords of the Sea} type Character card with a cost of 4 or less, you may play that card rested.
Legality: Standard not_legal; Extra Regulation legal
Variants: indexes 1, 2, and 0
FAQ: if the revealed card is not played, return it to the top of the deck face-down.
```

### Implementation consequences
<!-- SECTION_REF: 20-card-implementation-examples.s005 -->
Section Ref: `20-card-implementation-examples.s005`

`[DON!! x2]` is a source-attached DON!! condition, not a cost. The cost is `①`, paid by resting one active DON!! in the cost area.

The effect needs a transient public reveal zone/set. The revealed top card is public while revealed. If it is not played, it returns to the top of the deck face-down and must no longer be visible in either player's normal `PlayerView`.

If the revealed card is eligible, the controller may play it rested. The effect text does not say to pay its cost, so this is an effect-play with `ignoreCost: true`.

### Required DSL support
<!-- SECTION_REF: 20-card-implementation-examples.s006 -->
Section Ref: `20-card-implementation-examples.s006`

The current DSL must support all of these primitives:

```ts
// Conditions
{ type: 'attachedDonCount', target: { type: 'self' }, op: 'gte', value: 2 }

// Transient reveal set
{ type: 'revealTop', player: 'self', count: 1, saveAs: 'doffyReveal', visibility: 'bothPlayers' }

// Conditional selection from a transient set
{
  type: 'selectFromSet',
  set: 'doffyReveal',
  chooser: 'self',
  min: 0,
  max: 1,
  filter: {
    categories: ['character'],
    typesAny: ['The Seven Warlords of the Sea'],
    cost: { op: 'lte', value: 4 }
  },
  saveAs: 'doffyPlayChoice'
}

// Effect-play selected revealed card rested
{ type: 'playSelected', selection: 'doffyPlayChoice', enterRested: true, ignoreCost: true }

// Cleanup unplayed revealed card
{
  type: 'returnUnselectedToDeck',
  set: 'doffyReveal',
  player: 'self',
  position: 'top',
  order: 'original',
  faceDown: true
}
```

### Acceptance tests
<!-- SECTION_REF: 20-card-implementation-examples.s008 -->
Section Ref: `20-card-implementation-examples.s008`

```text
DOFFY-001 OP01-060 variant index 0 normalizes to OP01-060:v0 and is selectable in deck builder.
DOFFY-002 [DON!! x2] condition checks attached DON!! on leader, not total cost-area DON!!.
DOFFY-003 When attacking with two attached DON!! and one active DON!! in cost area, player may pay ①.
DOFFY-004 If player declines to pay ①, no top card is revealed.
DOFFY-005 Eligible top card can be played rested without paying cost.
DOFFY-006 Ineligible top card is revealed, then returns to top of deck face-down.
DOFFY-007 Eligible top card declined by player returns to top face-down.
DOFFY-008 Opponent sees the revealed card while revealed but not after it returns face-down.
DOFFY-009 Returning the card to top preserves deck order and does not shuffle.
DOFFY-010 If the revealed card is played, it leaves the transient reveal set and does not also return to deck.
```

## Example 2: OP05-091 Rebecca
<!-- SECTION_REF: 20-card-implementation-examples.s009 -->
Section Ref: `20-card-implementation-examples.s009`

### Poneglyph facts from fixture
<!-- SECTION_REF: 20-card-implementation-examples.s010 -->
Section Ref: `20-card-implementation-examples.s010`

```text
Card ID: OP05-091
Name: Rebecca
Category: Character
Color: Black
Cost: 4
Power: 0
Counter: 1000
Attribute: Wisdom
Types: Dressrosa
Effect: [Blocker]\n[On Play] Add up to 1 black Character card with a cost of 3 to 7 other than [Rebecca] from your trash to your hand. Then, play up to 1 black Character card with a cost of 3 or less from your hand rested.
Legality: Standard legal; Extra Regulation legal
Variants: indexes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
FAQ: the card added from trash may be played by the second part of the effect.
```

### Implementation consequences
<!-- SECTION_REF: 20-card-implementation-examples.s011 -->
Section Ref: `20-card-implementation-examples.s011`

`[Blocker]` should be implemented as a keyword available while the card is on the field.

The `[On Play]` effect is a sequence. The second step sees the updated hand after the first step. The official FAQ confirms that the card added from trash can be selected for the subsequent play step.

`other than [Rebecca]` is a name exclusion. It does not merely mean `excludeSelf`, because the source Rebecca is on the field and the searched zone is trash. The filter needs a card-name exclusion operator.

### Required DSL support
<!-- SECTION_REF: 20-card-implementation-examples.s012 -->
Section Ref: `20-card-implementation-examples.s012`

```ts
interface CardFilter {
  names?: string[];
  nameNot?: string[];
  colorsAny?: Color[];
  categories?: CardCategory[];
  cost?: { op: Comparator; value: number } | { min?: number; max?: number };
}
```

The play-from-hand effect must support `enterRested: true`, `ignoreCost: true`, and normal board-cap rule processing.

### Acceptance tests
<!-- SECTION_REF: 20-card-implementation-examples.s014 -->
Section Ref: `20-card-implementation-examples.s014`

```text
REBECCA-001 OP05-091 normalizes all variant indexes 0 through 5; null product set_code is accepted.
REBECCA-002 [Blocker] appears in computed view while Rebecca is on field.
REBECCA-003 On Play can choose zero cards from trash even when legal targets exist.
REBECCA-004 On Play cannot choose a card named Rebecca from trash.
REBECCA-005 On Play can choose a black Character cost 3-7 from trash and move it to hand.
REBECCA-006 The second step can play the exact card added to hand in the first step if it is black Character cost <=3.
REBECCA-007 The played card enters rested and does not require cost payment.
REBECCA-008 If the character area is full, the engine creates the correct forced-trash decision before the effect-play completes.
REBECCA-009 Private hand candidate list is visible only to Rebecca's controller.
REBECCA-010 The sequence is deterministic in replay and produces the same state hash. 
```

## DSL additions required by these examples
<!-- SECTION_REF: 20-card-implementation-examples.s015 -->
Section Ref: `20-card-implementation-examples.s015`

These examples prove the DSL should include the following before scaling beyond the first fixture set:

```ts
type Effect =
  | { type: 'revealTop'; player: PlayerRef; count: number; saveAs: SelectionSetId; visibility: Visibility }
  | { type: 'selectFromSet'; set: SelectionSetId; chooser: PlayerRef; min: number; max: number; filter?: CardFilter; saveAs: SelectionId }
  | { type: 'selectCards'; zone: Zone; player: PlayerRef; chooser: PlayerRef; min: number; max: number; filter?: CardFilter; saveAs: SelectionId; visibility: Visibility }
  | { type: 'playSelected'; selection: SelectionId; enterRested?: boolean; ignoreCost?: boolean }
  | { type: 'returnUnselectedToDeck'; set: SelectionSetId; player: PlayerRef; position: 'top' | 'bottom'; order: 'original' | 'ownerChoice' | 'random'; faceDown: boolean }
  | { type: 'moveSelected'; selection: SelectionId; from: Zone | SelectionSetId; to: Zone };

type Condition =
  | { type: 'attachedDonCount'; target: Target; op: Comparator; value: number };

interface CardFilter {
  nameNot?: string[];
  colorsAny?: Color[];
  typesAny?: string[];
  cost?: { op: Comparator; value: number } | { min?: number; max?: number };
}
```

Without these, both cards would need custom handlers even though their behavior is structurally normal.
