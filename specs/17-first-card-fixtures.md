# First Card Fixtures
<!-- SECTION_REF: 17-first-card-fixtures.s001 -->
Section Ref: `17-first-card-fixtures.s001`

## Purpose
<!-- SECTION_REF: 17-first-card-fixtures.s002 -->
Section Ref: `17-first-card-fixtures.s002`

The first fixture pool should cover engine mechanics, effect timing, hidden information, and DSL primitives without requiring the full card pool. Use Poneglyph-shaped IDs and metadata so migration to real Poneglyph records is easy.

## Fixture policy
<!-- SECTION_REF: 17-first-card-fixtures.s003 -->
Section Ref: `17-first-card-fixtures.s003`

- Use real-looking Poneglyph base IDs if testing with actual card data, or clearly prefixed fixture IDs if avoiding real cards.
- Each non-vanilla fixture has an implementation record.
- Each fixture has at least one test.
- The pool should be small enough that every interaction is understood.

## Recommended 20-card coverage set
<!-- SECTION_REF: 17-first-card-fixtures.s004 -->
Section Ref: `17-first-card-fixtures.s004`

| Slot | Fixture purpose | Mechanics covered |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Vanilla Leader | Setup, life, attacks, leader damage. |
| 2 | Vanilla Character 2-cost | Basic play, cost payment, summoning sickness. |
| 3 | Vanilla Character high power | Character battle and K.O. |
| 4 | Vanilla Stage | Stage play and stage replacement. |
| 5 | Character with counter value | Counter step, hand trash, temporary battle power. |
| 6 | `[Blocker]` Character | Block window, blocker rests, target redirection. |
| 7 | `[Rush]` Character | Can attack turn played. |
| 8 | `[Rush: Character]` Character | Can attack rested Characters but not Leader on play turn. |
| 9 | `[Double Attack]` Character | Multiple damage points and damage deferral. |
| 10 | `[Banish]` Character | Replacement of life-to-hand/trigger path. |
| 11 | `[On Play] Draw 1` | Auto trigger, draw event, rule processing. |
| 12 | `[When Attacking]` Draw/discard | Attack trigger, sequence effect, private discard decision. |
| 13 | `[On K.O.]` Draw 1 | Source leaves field, resolves from trash/last known info. |
| 14 | `[Trigger]` Life effect | Reveal from life, no-zone resolution, trash after trigger. |
| 15 | `[Counter]` Event + power | Counter event cost/trash/effect. |
| 16 | `[Main]` Event K.O. low-cost | Main event play, target selection, K.O. effect. |
| 17 | Permanent +1000 during your turn | Computed continuous effect, no state mutation. |
| 18 | Search/look top cards | Hidden-information private choice and reveal policy. |
| 19 | Protection/replacement effect | Replacement priority and one-use-per-process rule. |
| 20 | Custom-handler card | Escape hatch, handler registry, handler tests. |

## Minimal implementation records
<!-- SECTION_REF: 17-first-card-fixtures.s005 -->
Section Ref: `17-first-card-fixtures.s005`

```json
{
  "FX-001": {
    "status": "vanilla-confirmed",
    "tested": true,
    "rulesVersion": "1.2.0",
    "cardDataVersion": "fixture-v1",
    "sourceTextHash": "fixture"
  },
  "FX-011": {
    "status": "implemented-dsl",
    "effectDefinitionId": "FX-011@v1",
    "tested": true,
    "rulesVersion": "1.2.0",
    "cardDataVersion": "fixture-v1",
    "sourceTextHash": "fixture"
  }
}
```

## Fixture acceptance interactions
<!-- SECTION_REF: 17-first-card-fixtures.s006 -->
Section Ref: `17-first-card-fixtures.s006`

These interactions should exist as golden scripts:

- Vanilla Leader vs vanilla Leader match reaches a legal winner.
- Sixth Character rule-process trash does not fire `[On K.O.]`.
- Blocker redirects an attack and then the blocker can be K.O.'d.
- Double Attack processes two life cards before deferred triggers resolve.
- Banish trashes life and prevents normal trigger/hand path.
- `[On K.O.]` source leaves field and still resolves correctly.
- Search/look effect does not leak candidates to opponent.
- Permanent +1000 does not stack every recomputation.
- Replacement effect applies once to a process.
- Custom handler replay hash is deterministic.


## Real Poneglyph-backed fixtures added in v3
<!-- SECTION_REF: 17-first-card-fixtures.s007 -->
Section Ref: `17-first-card-fixtures.s007`

Use these two real card payloads immediately because they test the card-data adapter and effect DSL more effectively than pure fake cards.

| Card | Fixture path | Why it is included early |
|---|---|---|
| `OP01-060` Donquixote Doflamingo | `fixtures/poneglyph/cards/OP01-060.donquixote-doflamingo.json` | Tests variant index `0`, source-attached DON!! condition, paid attack trigger, public reveal, optional effect-play rested, and FAQ-driven face-down return. |
| `OP05-091` Rebecca | `fixtures/poneglyph/cards/OP05-091.rebecca.json` | Tests nullable variant fields, `[Blocker]`, trash-to-hand, then hand-to-field sequence, `other than [Rebecca]`, and FAQ-confirmed same-card play. |

These do not replace the 20-card coverage set. They anchor it to actual Poneglyph payloads so the adapter, effect DSL, and tests evolve together.

## Updated first fixture slice
<!-- SECTION_REF: 17-first-card-fixtures.s008 -->
Section Ref: `17-first-card-fixtures.s008`

For the first implementation sprint, use this tighter subset:

```text
1. FX-LEADER-VANILLA      - fake vanilla leader for minimal combat
2. FX-CHAR-VANILLA        - fake vanilla character for play/K.O.
3. FX-BLOCKER             - fake blocker if Rebecca is not yet loaded
4. FX-ONPLAY-DRAW         - simple on-play draw primitive
5. OP01-060               - real Doflamingo fixture, implemented after transient reveal primitives
6. OP05-091               - real Rebecca fixture, implemented after sequence-local selections
```

The fake cards keep the CLI loop simple. The real cards prove that the Poneglyph adapter and DSL are not drifting away from actual card payloads.
