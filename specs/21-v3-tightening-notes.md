The v2 rebuild restored Poneglyph as a named dependency, but it still treated the API shape too abstractly. The supplied OpenAPI JSON and card examples revealed implementation details that must be reflected in the docs before coding:

- Poneglyph variants use `index` in the provided payloads, not a standalone `variant_id`.
- Search results and detail results have different authority levels.
- Batch card lookup has a maximum of 60 card numbers per request.
- FAQ entries and errata can affect behavior and must feed implementation-review hashing.
- Some product/market fields are nullable and must not break deck rendering.
- Real effects need transient reveal sets, selected-card references, and sequence-local state.

## Implementation priority change

Build the engine first, but add `@optcg/cards` fixture schemas immediately. The first engine tests should load local Poneglyph-shaped fixtures rather than hand-typed fake card metadata. Live Poneglyph HTTP, Redis caching, and search UI can still wait until after the CLI engine loop works.
