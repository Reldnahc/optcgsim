# Source Map
<!-- SECTION_REF: source-map.s001 -->
Section Ref: `source-map.s001`

This package is based on three original PDFs:

- `optcg-simulator-plan.pdf`
- `optcg-engine-spec.pdf`
- `optcg-effect-system.pdf`

The detailed coverage table is in [`source-coverage-matrix.md`](source-coverage-matrix.md). The original extracted text is preserved in [`source-original-pdfs/`](source-original-pdfs/).

## Major source-to-doc moves

## Intentional changes from source drafts
<!-- SECTION_REF: source-map.s003 -->
Section Ref: `source-map.s003`

Some source draft choices were preserved but hardened:

- Missing effect definitions are no longer treated as safe vanilla defaults in public modes.
- `lastAction` trigger detection is replaced by an explicit event journal.
- Continuous effects produce a computed view instead of mutating canonical state repeatedly.
- Spectator delay is not only N turns; v2 supports time and action delay as well.
- Crash recovery does not blindly replay a crashing action; v2 uses recovery modes.
- Deck-card variant uniqueness is fixed to allow multiple variants of the same base Poneglyph card.
- Active-ban indexing avoids non-immutable `now()` in a Postgres partial index.

## Poneglyph coverage
<!-- SECTION_REF: source-map.s004 -->
Section Ref: `source-map.s004`

Poneglyph is explicitly covered in:

- `README.md` - high-level decision.
- `01-system-architecture.md` - topology and stack.
- `05-effect-dsl-reference.md` - card IDs and text-to-DSL pipeline.
- `09-card-data-and-support-policy.md` - detailed integration policy.
- `10-database-schema.md` - persisted Poneglyph IDs and variants.
- `12-roadmap.md` - original and revised build order.
- `13-legal-content-risk.md` - content/image/text handling risk.


## Poneglyph OpenAPI / supplied card examples
<!-- SECTION_REF: source-map.s005 -->
Section Ref: `source-map.s005`

| Supplied source | Added / tightened docs |
|---|---|
| Poneglyph OpenAPI JSON | `19-poneglyph-api-contract.md`, `16-typescript-interface-draft.md`, `18-acceptance-tests.md`, `fixtures/poneglyph/openapi.optcg-api-0.1.0.json` |
| `OP01-060` Donquixote Doflamingo payload | `20-card-implementation-examples.md`, `17-first-card-fixtures.md`, `18-acceptance-tests.md`, `fixtures/poneglyph/cards/OP01-060.donquixote-doflamingo.json` |
| `OP05-091` Rebecca payload | `20-card-implementation-examples.md`, `17-first-card-fixtures.md`, `18-acceptance-tests.md`, `fixtures/poneglyph/cards/OP05-091.rebecca.json` |

The supplied examples corrected the variant persistence model: use Poneglyph `variants[].index` and generate a simulator `variant_key`; do not assume a Poneglyph `variant_id` field exists.


## Official comprehensive rules PDF added in v4
<!-- SECTION_REF: source-map.s006 -->
Section Ref: `source-map.s006`

The supplied comprehensive rules PDF is included directly in the bundle as `source-official-rules/rule_comprehensive_v1.2.0_2026-01-16.pdf` and is reflected in `02-engine-mechanics.md`, `07-match-server-protocol.md`, `08-replay-rollback-recovery.md`, `09-card-data-and-support-policy.md`, and `18-acceptance-tests.md`.
