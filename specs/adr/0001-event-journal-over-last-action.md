# ADR 0001: Use an Event Journal Instead of `lastAction`
<!-- SECTION_REF: 0001-event-journal-over-last-action.s001 -->
Section Ref: `0001-event-journal-over-last-action.s001`

## Status
<!-- SECTION_REF: 0001-event-journal-over-last-action.s002 -->
Section Ref: `0001-event-journal-over-last-action.s002`

Accepted.

## Context
<!-- SECTION_REF: 0001-event-journal-over-last-action.s003 -->
Section Ref: `0001-event-journal-over-last-action.s003`

Card effects can cause several atomic state changes. Each change may trigger different effects. A single `lastAction` value is not expressive enough to support correct trigger detection, replay debugging, or audit logs.

## Decision
<!-- SECTION_REF: 0001-event-journal-over-last-action.s004 -->
Section Ref: `0001-event-journal-over-last-action.s004`

Every atomic mutation emits structured `EngineEvent`s. Trigger detection consumes event batches.

## Consequences
<!-- SECTION_REF: 0001-event-journal-over-last-action.s005 -->
Section Ref: `0001-event-journal-over-last-action.s005`

Positive:

- Trigger detection is precise.
- Replays are easier to inspect.
- Debugging has a causality trail.
- Hidden-information filtering can operate on event visibility.

Negative:

- More data to design and store.
- More tests needed for event payload correctness.

## Implementation notes
<!-- SECTION_REF: 0001-event-journal-over-last-action.s006 -->
Section Ref: `0001-event-journal-over-last-action.s006`

`EngineEvent` must include type, source, affected cards, payload, cause, visibility, and sequence metadata.
