# ADR 0003: Continuous Effects Produce a Computed View
<!-- SECTION_REF: 0003-continuous-effects-computed-view.s001 -->
Section Ref: `0003-continuous-effects-computed-view.s001`

## Status
<!-- SECTION_REF: 0003-continuous-effects-computed-view.s002 -->
Section Ref: `0003-continuous-effects-computed-view.s002`

Accepted.

## Context
<!-- SECTION_REF: 0003-continuous-effects-computed-view.s003 -->
Section Ref: `0003-continuous-effects-computed-view.s003`

A fixed-point loop that mutates canonical state risks repeatedly applying modifiers such as `+1000 power` and mixing base facts with derived values.

## Decision
<!-- SECTION_REF: 0003-continuous-effects-computed-view.s004 -->
Section Ref: `0003-continuous-effects-computed-view.s004`

Canonical state stores base facts and active modifier records. `computeView(state)` derives current power, cost, keywords, restrictions, and protections.

## Consequences
<!-- SECTION_REF: 0003-continuous-effects-computed-view.s005 -->
Section Ref: `0003-continuous-effects-computed-view.s005`

Positive:

- Prevents double-application of modifiers.
- Makes state hashes more stable.
- Keeps replay state cleaner.
- Makes expiration easier to reason about.

Negative:

- Computed view performance must be measured.
- Some rule interactions may require careful layering.

## Implementation notes
<!-- SECTION_REF: 0003-continuous-effects-computed-view.s006 -->
Section Ref: `0003-continuous-effects-computed-view.s006`

If official rules require fixed-point processing, run the fixed point over computed views/modifier activation, not by writing derived values into canonical card state.
