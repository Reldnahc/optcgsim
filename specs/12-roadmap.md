# Roadmap
<!-- SECTION_REF: 12-roadmap.s001 -->
Section Ref: `12-roadmap.s001`

## v6 milestone gates
<!-- SECTION_REF: 12-roadmap.s002 -->
Section Ref: `12-roadmap.s002`

Milestone 0 may start immediately. Milestone 1 may start for the vanilla engine and fixture adapter. Full effect runtime, production server, DB migrations, ranked spectator flows, and public alpha are gated by the checklist in `22-v6-implementation-tightening.md`.

Required gates before full card/effect implementation:

```text
[ ] contracts/canonical-types.ts compiles in CI
[ ] effect DSL fixtures validate against contracts/effect-dsl.schema.json
[ ] life orientation, main-phase start trigger, counter-step, post-counter legality tests pass
[ ] effect queue generation ordering tests pass
[ ] replacement choice/chaining tests pass
[ ] replay reconstruction source policy implemented
[ ] database-schema-v6.sql accepted by migration tooling
```


## Revised build order
<!-- SECTION_REF: 12-roadmap.s003 -->
Section Ref: `12-roadmap.s003`

The project should prove the engine before building too much infrastructure.

1. `@optcg/types`
2. `@optcg/engine-core` with hardcoded sample card metadata
3. CLI game runner with 10–20 cards
4. Event journal + pending decision model
5. Invariant tests and basic fuzz tests
6. Minimal `@optcg/effects` definitions for sample cards
7. Minimal `@optcg/cards` adapter, no Redis requirement yet
8. Minimal browser board using mocked/local filtered views
9. Match server with WebSocket sequencing/idempotency
10. Redis recovery baseline
11. Platform API: auth, deck builder, deck validation
12. Replay viewer
13. Bot
14. Unranked queue, custom lobbies, ranked ladder, spectator, tournament features

## Open decisions
<!-- SECTION_REF: 12-roadmap.s013 -->
Section Ref: `12-roadmap.s013`

| Decision | Recommendation | Needed by |
|---|---|---|
| Effect DSL storage | Repo JSON/JSONC in Phase 1 | Milestone 2 |
| Frontend hosting | Any static host; decide later | Milestone 4 |
| WebSocket library | `ws` for control or `socket.io` for ergonomics | Milestone 4 |
| Replay snapshot storage | Postgres JSONB first, object storage later | Milestone 6 |
| Card images | Decide legal/content mode before public alpha | Milestone 7 |
| Spectator ranked mode | Deferred; ranked matches are not spectatable in the initial implementation | Later milestone |
| Ranking formula | Start simple Elo; migrate later if needed | Milestone 8 |

## Risk register
<!-- SECTION_REF: 12-roadmap.s014 -->
Section Ref: `12-roadmap.s014`

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Hidden-info leak | Severe trust failure | Default-hidden views, tests, no full state on client |
| Effect queue bug | Incorrect games | Event journal, golden replays, interaction tests |
| Unsupported card allowed | Silent unfairness | Support registry and deck validation |
| Replay drift | Replays unusable | Version headers and checkpoint hashes |
| Continuous effect mutation | State corruption | Computed view layer only |
| Crash loops on recovery | Match cannot recover | Recovery modes and freeze-for-review |
| Scope creep | Never ships | Narrow sample-card milestones |
| Card-data source downtime | Deck/match start failures | Cache and clear degraded behavior |
| Legal/content issue | Public launch blocked | Decide image/trademark/takedown policy early |
| Contributor churn | Modules abandoned | Small package boundaries and docs |

## Immediate next tasks
<!-- SECTION_REF: 12-roadmap.s015 -->
Section Ref: `12-roadmap.s015`

1. Create `@optcg/types` skeleton.
2. Define `GameState`, `PlayerView`, `Action`, `EngineEvent`, `PendingDecision` types.
3. Write invariant utilities.
4. Implement deterministic RNG wrapper.
5. Implement setup and vanilla turn flow.
6. Create CLI runner.
7. Add first golden replay test.

## Original phase plan preserved
<!-- SECTION_REF: 12-roadmap.s016 -->
Section Ref: `12-roadmap.s016`

The original simulator plan used broad time-boxed phases. The revised milestone order above changes the solo-dev sequencing, but the original phases are still useful as a product-level roadmap.

### Original Phase 1 - Foundation, weeks 1-4
<!-- SECTION_REF: 12-roadmap.s017 -->
Section Ref: `12-roadmap.s017`

- Set up monorepo with Turborepo or equivalent.
- Define `@optcg/types` for card schema, game state shape, action types, and shared contracts.
- Build `@optcg/cards` with Poneglyph API client, local/cache layer, and validation.
- Validate that Poneglyph card data matches the engine's expected card schema.
- Implement core `@optcg/engine-core` turn flow with a handful of vanilla cards.
- Write a CLI test harness that plays a terminal game against the engine.

### Original Phase 2 - Playable prototype, weeks 5-10
<!-- SECTION_REF: 12-roadmap.s018 -->
Section Ref: `12-roadmap.s018`

- Stand up `@optcg/match-server`.
- Allow two clients to connect and play a basic match.
- Build initial client board, hand display, card play, and attack UI.
- Implement platform auth and deck builder endpoints.
- Run first browser-based human playtest.

### Original Phase 3 - Feature completion, weeks 11-18
<!-- SECTION_REF: 12-roadmap.s019 -->
Section Ref: `12-roadmap.s019`

- Expand engine to cover effects, keywords, triggers, and counter steps.
- Expand card data coverage toward all released sets from Poneglyph.
- Add matchmaking, Elo/rating, and game history.
- Polish client animations, sound, responsive layout, and mobile support.
- Build a basic bot opponent.

### Original Phase 4 - Launch and iterate
<!-- SECTION_REF: 12-roadmap.s020 -->
Section Ref: `12-roadmap.s020`

- Replay system.
- Spectator mode.
- Tournament/lobby features.
- Community features such as deck sharing and ratings.
- Performance optimization and scaling.
- New set releases as card-data/effect-definition updates.

## Why the revised solo order differs
<!-- SECTION_REF: 12-roadmap.s021 -->
Section Ref: `12-roadmap.s021`

The original plan placed `@optcg/cards` and Redis early. The revised solo-development order starts with `@optcg/types`, `@optcg/engine-core`, a CLI runner, and sample hardcoded Poneglyph-shaped card IDs before full Poneglyph/Redis integration. That reduces infrastructure work before proving the hardest part: correct gameplay.

Once the terminal engine works, add `@optcg/cards` and Poneglyph read-through cache as the bridge from fixture cards to real card data.
