# Legal and Content Risk
<!-- SECTION_REF: 13-legal-content-risk.s001 -->
Section Ref: `13-legal-content-risk.s001`

## Purpose
<!-- SECTION_REF: 13-legal-content-risk.s002 -->
Section Ref: `13-legal-content-risk.s002`

A public simulator using official card names, text, images, set symbols, and trademarks carries legal and platform risk. This document is not legal advice. It is a product-risk checklist to resolve before public launch.

## Risk areas
<!-- SECTION_REF: 13-legal-content-risk.s003 -->
Section Ref: `13-legal-content-risk.s003`

### Card images
<!-- SECTION_REF: 13-legal-content-risk.s004 -->
Section Ref: `13-legal-content-risk.s004`

Questions to answer:

- Are official card images displayed?
- Are images hotlinked, proxied, cached, transformed, or uploaded by users?
- Are alternate-art variants stored or merely referenced?
- Is there a fast operational switch to disable image rendering if needed?
- Is image access limited to private/local use or public matchmaking?

Lower-risk fallback:

- Text-only cards.
- Generic frames.
- User-provided local image URLs not stored by the service.
- Disable image caching on server.

### Card text
<!-- SECTION_REF: 13-legal-content-risk.s005 -->
Section Ref: `13-legal-content-risk.s005`

Printed card text may also be protected content. If stored locally, track source and update policy. Consider minimizing local storage to IDs + effect implementation overlays, loading display text from user/client-side sources where appropriate.

### Trademarks and branding
<!-- SECTION_REF: 13-legal-content-risk.s006 -->
Section Ref: `13-legal-content-risk.s006`

Avoid using official logos or names in a way that implies endorsement.

Checklist:

- App name does not imply official status.
- Landing page says the project is unofficial/fan-made if appropriate.
- No official logos in app branding unless permission is obtained.
- No monetization claim tied to official IP without review.

### Monetization
<!-- SECTION_REF: 13-legal-content-risk.s007 -->
Section Ref: `13-legal-content-risk.s007`

Monetization increases risk. Before any monetization:

- Review with counsel.
- Avoid selling access to copyrighted card images/text.
- Avoid lootbox/collection monetization around real card assets.
- Keep donations/support clearly separate from access to official content.

### Takedown process
<!-- SECTION_REF: 13-legal-content-risk.s008 -->
Section Ref: `13-legal-content-risk.s008`

Before public launch, define:

- Contact email.
- Takedown review process.
- How to disable specific images/assets quickly.
- How to run text-only mode if image use is challenged.
- Logging of removed content.

## Content operating modes
<!-- SECTION_REF: 13-legal-content-risk.s009 -->
Section Ref: `13-legal-content-risk.s009`

| Mode | Description | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| Text-only | No official card images, generic UI | Lowest-risk public fallback |
| Client-fetched images | Browser loads images from source; server does not cache | Casual display, still needs review |
| Server-cached images | Server stores/proxies images | Higher risk; avoid until reviewed |
| User-provided images | User controls local/custom art | Private/local customization |
| Licensed images | Explicit permission | Ideal but may be unavailable |

## Launch blockers
<!-- SECTION_REF: 13-legal-content-risk.s010 -->
Section Ref: `13-legal-content-risk.s010`

Do not launch public ranked/tournament play until these decisions are made:

- Image handling mode selected.
- Branding reviewed.
- Takedown contact/process exists.
- Text-only fallback works.
- Source-card outage behavior is clear.
- Terms/community rules cover user conduct and content.

## Practical recommendation
<!-- SECTION_REF: 13-legal-content-risk.s011 -->
Section Ref: `13-legal-content-risk.s011`

For early development:

1. Build the engine and gameplay without relying on official images.
2. Support generic card rendering from metadata.
3. Keep card-image handling behind a feature flag.
4. Do not monetize.
5. Add text-only/proxy mode before public alpha.

This keeps the engine work unblocked while leaving room to adjust content strategy before public exposure.

## Poneglyph-specific content questions
<!-- SECTION_REF: 13-legal-content-risk.s012 -->
Section Ref: `13-legal-content-risk.s012`

Because the architecture uses Poneglyph as the card-data source, decide these before public launch:

- Does the server cache only Poneglyph metadata, or also image URLs/images?
- Are Poneglyph image URLs sent directly to the client, proxied through the server, or disabled behind a text-only mode?
- Are Poneglyph alternate-art variant indexes/generated variant keys stored permanently in decks?
- What happens if Poneglyph removes or changes an image/text entry?
- Is there a clear attribution or usage statement if appropriate?
- Is there a fallback for generic text-only cards if Poneglyph images cannot be used publicly?
- Does the takedown process disable image display, card text display, or both?

v4 product choice: images are enabled. Keep an operational image kill-switch and graceful fallback behavior if image availability or legal posture changes.
