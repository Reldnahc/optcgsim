# Effect Runtime
<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s001 -->
Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s001`

## Overview
<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s002 -->
Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s002`

The effect runtime executes effect definitions against the authoritative game state.

```text
Effect definitions        Runtime                 Engine core
DSL + custom handlers --> queue/choices/events --> atomic state mutations
```

The runtime must preserve timing, hidden information, source-presence rules, replacement effects, and deterministic replay.

**v6 contract:** queue entries, decisions, replacement state, and continuous-effect records are defined in [`contracts/canonical-types.ts`](contracts/canonical-types.ts). The algorithms below are normative when they are more precise than older snippets.

## Effect categories
<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s003 -->
Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s003`

| Category | Runtime behavior |
|---|---|
| Auto | Detected from `EngineEvent`s and queued. |
| Activate | Exposed through legal actions during valid timing windows. |
| Permanent | Contributes continuous modifiers to computed view. |
| Replacement | Intercepts replaceable processes before atomic mutation. |

## Stable effect identity
<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s004 -->
Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s004`

Every effect block has a stable ID. Never key `[Once Per Turn]` by array index.

```ts
interface EffectBlock {
  id: string; // e.g. "OP01-001:auto-1" or "OP01-040:activate-main-1"
  trigger: Trigger;
  category: EffectCategory;
  condition?: Condition;
  cost?: Cost;
  optional?: boolean;
  oncePerTurn?: boolean;
  failurePolicy?: FailurePolicy;
  sourcePresencePolicy?: SourcePresencePolicy;
  effect: Effect;
}
```

The `id` should remain stable across definition edits unless the effect's identity truly changes.

## Card implementation support
<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s005 -->
Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s005`

Effects load only from supported implementation records.

```ts
type CardSupportStatus =
  | 'vanilla-confirmed'
  | 'implemented-dsl'
  | 'implemented-custom'
  | 'unsupported'
  | 'banned-in-simulator';
```

A missing effect definition for a non-vanilla card is an error in normal play. Only dev/sandbox modes may allow unsupported cards.

## Effect queue entry
<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s006 -->
Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s006`

```ts
interface EffectQueueEntry {
  id: QueueEntryId;
  state: 'pending' | 'resolving' | 'resolved' | 'cancelled';
  timingWindowId: TimingWindowId;
  generation: number;
  controllerId: PlayerId;
  source: CardRef;
  sourceSnapshot: CardSnapshot;
  triggerEventId?: EngineEventId;
  effectBlockId: EffectId;
  orderingGroup: 'turnPlayer' | 'nonTurnPlayer';
  createdAtEventSeq: number;
  queuedAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
  sourcePresencePolicy: SourcePresencePolicy;
  causedBy: CausalityRef;
}
```

## Source presence policy
<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s007 -->
Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s007`

A simple "cancel if source moved" rule is not enough. Zone-transition triggers such as `[On K.O.]` must activate on field and resolve after the card moves to trash.

```ts
type SourcePresencePolicy =
  | 'mustRemainInSameZone'
  | 'resolveFromDestinationZone'
  | 'resolveFromLastKnownInformation'
  | 'noSourceRequired';
```

Recommended defaults:

| Trigger/effect kind | Policy |
|---|---|
| `[When Attacking]` | `mustRemainInSameZone` |
| `[On Your Opponent's Attack]` | `mustRemainInSameZone` |
| `[On Block]` | `mustRemainInSameZone` |
| `[On K.O.]` | `resolveFromDestinationZone` or `resolveFromLastKnownInformation`, depending on ruling/implementation |
| `[Trigger]` from life | `resolveFromLastKnownInformation` or `noSourceRequired` while in no zone |
| Event `[Main]` / `[Counter]` | `resolveFromDestinationZone` after event is trashed |
| Global rule-created effect | `noSourceRequired` |

## Trigger detection from events
<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s008 -->
Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s008`

Trigger detection consumes event batches.

```ts
function detectTriggeredEffects(
  state: GameState,
  events: EngineEvent[]
): TriggerCandidate[] {
  const candidates: TriggerCandidate[] = [];

  for (const event of events) {
    candidates.push(...findAutoEffectsForEvent(state, event));
    candidates.push(...findReplacementFollowupsIfAny(state, event));
  }

  return candidates.filter(c => canTriggerNow(c, state));
}
```

The engine must check source presence before queueing, then apply the queue entry's source-presence policy before resolution.

## Queue ordering
<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s009 -->
Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s009`

Every trigger collection creates or joins a timing window. Queue order is deterministic and must not depend on JavaScript array discovery order except where the spec explicitly says discovery order is the canonical tie-breaker.

Normative ordering algorithm:

```text
1. Assign every collected trigger a timingWindowId.
2. Assign generation = 0 for effects triggered by the original timing event.
3. When resolving an effect produces new triggers, enqueue them with generation = currentGeneration + 1 in the same timing window unless a new official timing window has opened.
4. Resolve older timing windows before newer timing windows.
5. Within a timing window, resolve lower generation before higher generation.
6. Within a generation, resolve turn-player bucket before non-turn-player bucket.
7. Within a player's bucket, if more than one effect is pending, create chooseTriggerOrder for that player.
8. If no choice is required, use stable tie-breakers: createdAtEventSeq, then source instance id, then effect id.
```

Consequences:

- If turn player effect A and non-turn player effect B are pending, and A creates turn player effect C while resolving, B resolves before C.
- Effects triggered during damage processing wait until all damage points are complete, except `[Trigger]` resolution itself.
- Effects triggered during an effect or card activation wait until the triggering process completes.
- Optional triggered effects create `chooseOptionalActivation` decisions at the point they would enter or begin resolution, according to the card's timing rule.

## Queue processing
<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s010 -->
Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s010`

```ts
function processEffectQueue(state: GameState): EngineResult {
  let allEvents: EngineEvent[] = [];

  while (state.effectQueue.length > 0) {
    const entry = dequeueEffect(state);
    state = markResolving(state, entry.id);

    if (!canQueuedEffectResolve(entry, state)) {
      const cancelled = cancelQueuedEffect(state, entry, 'source-or-condition-failed');
      state = cancelled.state;
      allEvents.push(...cancelled.events);
      continue;
    }

    const resolution = executeEffectBlock(state, entry);
    state = resolution.state;
    allEvents.push(...resolution.events);

    const checked = checkRuleProcessingWithEvents(state, { causedBy: { type: 'effect', queueEntryId: entry.id, effectId: entry.effectBlock.id } });
    state = checked.state;
    allEvents.push(...checked.events);

    if (state.status.type === 'gameOver') {
      return { state, events: allEvents, stateHash: hashState(state) };
    }

    const triggered = detectTriggeredEffects(state, resolution.events);
    state = enqueueTriggeredEffectsRespectingTiming(state, triggered);
  }

  return { state, events: allEvents, stateHash: hashState(state) };
}
```

There is no `return` inside the loop unless the game ends, an unrecoverable error occurs, or a pending decision pauses resolution.

## Conditions and costs
<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s011 -->
Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s011`

Before resolving an effect block:

1. Check source presence policy.
2. Re-check condition if the effect requires condition-on-resolution.
3. Check `[Once Per Turn]` usage by `source.instanceId + effectBlock.id + turn`.
4. If activation requires cost, create a `PayCostDecision` when choices are required.
5. Pay cost atomically and emit `costPaid` events.
6. Mark once-per-turn usage only after legal commitment: activation conditions passed, required activation-time targets selected, costs paid, and optional activation accepted. Declined optional effects and failed costs do not consume use; legally committed effects that later fizzle do consume use.

```ts
interface OncePerTurnRecord {
  cardInstanceId: InstanceId;
  effectId: string;
  turnNumber: number;
  usedAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}
```

## Player choices during effect resolution
<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s012 -->
Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s012`

Effects pause through `PendingDecision`.

Example target selection flow:

```ts
function executeKoEffect(state: GameState, effect: KoEffect, context: EffectContext): EngineResult {
  const candidates = resolveTargetCandidates(state, effect.target, context);

  if (requiresChoice(effect.target)) {
    return pauseForDecision(state, {
      type: 'selectTargets',
      playerId: resolveChooser(effect.target, context),
      request: effect.target,
      candidates,
      causedBy: context.causedBy,
    });
  }

  return koTargets(state, candidates.selected, context);
}
```

Decision responses are validated by the engine, not the client.

## Replacement effects
<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s013 -->
Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s013`

Replacement effects intercept replaceable processes.

```ts
interface ReplacementProcess {
  id: string;
  type: ReplaceableProcessType;
  source?: CardRef;
  target?: CardRef;
  payload: unknown;
  causedBy: CausalityRef;
  usedReplacementIds: string[];
}
```

Processing order:

1. Replacements generated by the card/process being replaced, if applicable.
2. Turn player's applicable replacements in chosen order.
3. Non-turn player's applicable replacements in chosen order.

A replacement cannot apply twice to the same replacement process. If a replacement cannot actually perform its replacement, it does not apply.

```ts
function executeReplaceableProcess(state: GameState, process: ReplacementProcess): EngineStepResult {
  let current = process;
  let currentState = state;

  while (true) {
    const replacements = findApplicableReplacements(currentState, current)
      .filter(r => !current.usedReplacementIds.includes(r.id))
      .filter(r => canApplyReplacement(r, currentState, current));

    if (replacements.length === 0) {
      return executeUnreplacedProcess(currentState, current);
    }

    const choice = chooseReplacementByPriorityOrDecision(currentState, replacements, current);

    if (choice.pausedForDecision) {
      return choice.result;
    }

    if (!choice.chosen) {
      return executeUnreplacedProcess(currentState, current);
    }

    current = {
      ...transformProcessByReplacement(choice.chosen, currentState, current),
      usedReplacementIds: [...current.usedReplacementIds, choice.chosen.id],
    };

    currentState = emitReplacementApplied(currentState, choice.chosen, current).state;
  }
}
```

Replacement decisions use `PendingDecision.chooseReplacement`. Optional replacements may be declined; mandatory replacements cannot be declined unless more than one mandatory replacement requires a controller-chosen order. A replacement cannot apply twice to the same `process.id`, even if the process is transformed into a new shape.

Every applied replacement emits `replacementApplied` with the original process ID, selected replacement ID, old process payload hash, and transformed process payload hash. This event is at least `replayOnly` and may be public when the replacement effect is public.

## Continuous effects as computed view
<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s014 -->
Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s014`

Continuous and permanent effects do not mutate canonical state on every recalculation. They generate modifiers, and a computed view applies them.

```ts
interface ContinuousEffectRecord {
  id: string;
  source: CardRef;
  sourceSnapshot: CardSnapshot;
  controller: PlayerId;
  modifier: Modifier;
  duration: Duration;
  condition?: Condition;
  createdBy: CausalityRef;
  createdAtStateSeq: StateSeq;
}

interface Modifier {
  layer: ModifierLayer;
  target: TargetSpec;
  operation: ModifierOperation;
}

type ModifierLayer =
  | 'basePowerSet'
  | 'baseCostSet'
  | 'powerAdd'
  | 'costAdd'
  | 'keywordAdd'
  | 'keywordRemove'
  | 'restriction'
  | 'protection';
```

Computing a view:

```ts
function computeView(state: GameState): ComputedGameView {
  const base = buildBaseView(state);
  const activeModifiers = collectActiveContinuousEffects(state);
  return applyModifierLayers(base, activeModifiers, state.turn.turnPlayerId);
}
```

Permanent effects may depend on the computed state. If the official rule requires fixed-point behavior, implement the fixed-point over computed views, not by writing current power/cost into canonical state.

## Duration expiration
<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s015 -->
Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s015`

| Duration | Expiration point |
|---|---|
| `thisBattle` | End of Battle |
| `thisTurn` | End Phase cleanup |
| `untilEndOfTurn` | End Phase cleanup |
| `untilStartOfNextTurn` | Start of specified player's next Refresh Phase |
| `whileSourceOnField` | When source leaves required zone |
| `whileConditionTrue` | Not active when condition false; removed or ignored by policy |
| `permanent` | Only for true game-permanent changes; avoid for field buffs |

## Failure policy
<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s016 -->
Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s016`

```ts
type FailurePolicy =
  | 'doAsMuchAsPossible'
  | 'requiresAll'
  | 'skipIfNoLegalTarget'
  | 'optionalIfPossible';
```

Default is `doAsMuchAsPossible`, unless a connector or card text requires dependency.

## Transient reveal and selection sets
<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s017 -->
Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s017`

Transient sets are part of effect execution context, not normal zones. They exist for patterns such as revealing the top card, selecting from a revealed set, and returning unselected cards face-down.

Rules:

1. A transient set has an origin, visibility, and cleanup policy.
2. Cards in a transient set are not simultaneously in hand/deck/trash/life.
3. Movement from a transient set to a real zone must emit a `cardMoved` event with appropriate visibility.
4. If an effect exits early, cleanup policy runs before the queue continues.
5. Opponent views may see a revealed card only for the duration and visibility specified by the effect. If the card returns face-down to a hidden zone, future opponent views must not retain its ID.

## Custom handlers
<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s018 -->
Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s018`

Custom handlers are an escape hatch, not a shortcut.

Use a custom handler when:

- The effect needs state tracking not represented by DSL primitives.
- The effect modifies core rules.
- The effect has complex nested choices that would make the DSL unreadable.
- A new DSL primitive would be premature for a one-off effect.

Handlers must be pure, immutable, deterministic, and test-covered.

```ts
interface CustomHandler {
  id: string;
  cardId: CardId;
  effectId: string;
  execute(state: GameState, context: EffectContext): EngineResult;
}
```

If several handlers repeat the same logic, promote that behavior into a DSL primitive.

## Effect logging
<!-- SECTION_REF: 04-effect-runtime.s019 -->
Section Ref: `04-effect-runtime.s019`

For replay, log:

- Triggering player action.
- Public and private decisions/responses.
- Random choices/shuffles by RNG call count.
- Effect IDs queued/resolved/cancelled.
- State hashes at checkpoints.

Do not rely on transient JavaScript function behavior for replay. Custom handler versions must be part of `effectDefinitionsVersion` or their own handler version manifest.
