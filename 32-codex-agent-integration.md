# Codex Agent Integration
<!-- SECTION_REF: 32-codex-agent-integration.s001 -->
Section Ref: `32-codex-agent-integration.s001`

This document defines how the spec-driven story system should integrate with Codex and similar code agents.

## Design goal
<!-- SECTION_REF: 32-codex-agent-integration.s002 -->
Section Ref: `32-codex-agent-integration.s002`

Agents should receive just enough authoritative context to complete one constrained story safely, with the specification still serving as the root authority.

## Required repo artifacts
<!-- SECTION_REF: 32-codex-agent-integration.s003 -->
Section Ref: `32-codex-agent-integration.s003`

A repo using this workflow should check in:

- `AGENTS.md` at repo root,
- approved story files validated by [`contracts/story.schema.json`](contracts/story.schema.json),
- agent packets generated from approved stories,
- the board sync tool `tools/spec_board_sync.py`,
- board sync metadata under `stories/.sync/`,
- optional Codex skills under [`.agents/skills/`](.agents/skills/) for repeatable workflows.

## Authority order for Codex tasks
<!-- SECTION_REF: 32-codex-agent-integration.s004 -->
Section Ref: `32-codex-agent-integration.s004`

For Codex execution:

1. cited specification sections,
2. approved story file,
3. generated agent packet,
4. checked-in repo instructions in `AGENTS.md`,
5. local code reality,
6. proposed patch.

If a lower layer conflicts with a higher one, the higher layer wins.

## Context-minimization rule
<!-- SECTION_REF: 32-codex-agent-integration.s005 -->
Section Ref: `32-codex-agent-integration.s005`

Do not hand the full spec to Codex unless the task genuinely spans many systems. Prefer a minimal packet with exact section refs, exact acceptance criteria, non-scope, and required tests.

## Root AGENTS contract
<!-- SECTION_REF: 32-codex-agent-integration.s006 -->
Section Ref: `32-codex-agent-integration.s006`

`AGENTS.md` should tell Codex:

- where the spec lives,
- how to find approved stories and packets,
- that section refs are the canonical citation keys,
- that gameplay, visibility, replay, fairness, and persistence ambiguity must fail closed,
- what verification commands to run before claiming completion,
- how to format assumptions, blockers, and implementation notes,
- that GitHub issue and board projection should run through `tools/spec_board_sync.py` and write metadata to `stories/.sync/`.

## Skill usage model
<!-- SECTION_REF: 32-codex-agent-integration.s007 -->
Section Ref: `32-codex-agent-integration.s007`

Use root-level Codex skills for repeatable task classes such as:

- implement one approved story,
- review one patch against a story,
- sync approved stories into GitHub issue bodies and board fields,
- raise ambiguity issues when cited sections do not decide behavior.

A skill should accelerate a workflow, not replace the authoritative story or packet.

## Recommended execution flow
<!-- SECTION_REF: 32-codex-agent-integration.s008 -->
Section Ref: `32-codex-agent-integration.s008`

1. Approve a story.
2. Generate an agent packet.
3. Run `python3 tools/spec_board_sync.py --story <path> --dry-run --write-preview`, then perform live sync when ready.
4. Assign the packet to Codex CLI or Codex cloud.
5. Have Codex implement the story in a branch or worktree.
6. Require tests and a short assumptions/blockers note.
7. Link the pull request back to the story issue.
8. Run Codex review plus human review before merge.

## Codex packet footer
<!-- SECTION_REF: 32-codex-agent-integration.s009 -->
Section Ref: `32-codex-agent-integration.s009`

Recommended footer for implementation tasks:

```text
Implement only the approved story.
Do not invent uncited behavior.
Keep changes inside the declared scope.
Run or update the required tests.
List any assumptions explicitly.
If the spec is ambiguous, stop at the narrowest safe point and open/append an ambiguity note.
```

## Review flow
<!-- SECTION_REF: 32-codex-agent-integration.s010 -->
Section Ref: `32-codex-agent-integration.s010`

Use Codex review as a fast first-pass reviewer for scope creep, missing tests, and obvious contract drift, but do not treat a passing agent review as authoritative proof of correctness. Human review still owns final acceptance for gameplay correctness and policy-sensitive areas.

## GitHub-connected modes
<!-- SECTION_REF: 32-codex-agent-integration.s011 -->
Section Ref: `32-codex-agent-integration.s011`

Codex may be used in three complementary ways:

- local/CLI implementation against a checked-out repo,
- cloud task execution against a connected GitHub repository,
- GitHub pull-request review using `@codex review`.

These modes should share the same story, packet, and `AGENTS.md` guidance so the execution rules do not vary by surface.

## Minimal task prompt
<!-- SECTION_REF: 32-codex-agent-integration.s012 -->
Section Ref: `32-codex-agent-integration.s012`

```text
Implement approved story SEC-005 from stories/approved/SEC-005.story.yaml.
Read AGENTS.md first.
Use agent-packets/SEC-005.packet.md as the constrained execution packet.
Do not exceed story scope.
Run the required tests and report exact files changed, tests run, and any ambiguity surfaced.
```

## Merge gate recommendation
<!-- SECTION_REF: 32-codex-agent-integration.s013 -->
Section Ref: `32-codex-agent-integration.s013`

A Codex-authored patch should not be merged unless:

- the linked story is still `approved`,
- the patch satisfies the listed acceptance criteria,
- required tests are present and passing,
- no uncited behavior is introduced,
- the review record includes either `@codex review` or an equivalent human review step.
