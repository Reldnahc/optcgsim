## Package boundaries
<!-- SECTION_REF: 01-system-architecture.s003 -->
Section Ref: `01-system-architecture.s003`

### `@optcg/bot`
<!-- SECTION_REF: 01-system-architecture.s012 -->
Section Ref: `01-system-architecture.s012`

Computer opponents.

Consumes `engine-core` directly in server/test contexts. In live matches, the bot submits actions through the same server path as a human player.

## Data authority
<!-- SECTION_REF: 01-system-architecture.s013 -->
Section Ref: `01-system-architecture.s013`

| Data | Authority |
|---|---|
| Full match state | Match server + `engine-core` |
| Hidden zones | Server only |
| Card rules/effects | Server-loaded card/effect registry |
| Deck legality | Platform API and match server re-validation |
| Visual card art variant | Loadout data, cosmetic only |
| User profile/settings | Platform API |
| Replays | Match server writes; replay service reads |

## Client prediction policy
<!-- SECTION_REF: 01-system-architecture.s014 -->
Section Ref: `01-system-architecture.s014`

The client may predict only presentation, not authority.

Allowed:

- Animate a card toward the board after the player clicks a valid action button.
- Highlight targets provided by the server as legal candidates.
- Pre-render known public state updates while waiting for server confirmation.

Not allowed:

- Compute legal actions using full hidden state.
- Infer whether the opponent has counter actions by timing windows.
- Receive deck order, opponent hand contents, face-down life contents, RNG seed, or effect queue internals.
- Decide outcome of any rule interaction without server confirmation.

## Versioning
<!-- SECTION_REF: 01-system-architecture.s015 -->
Section Ref: `01-system-architecture.s015`

Version these independently:

```ts
interface RuntimeVersionSet {
  engineVersion: string;
  rulesVersion: string;
  cardDataVersion: string;
  effectDefinitionsVersion: string;
  banlistVersion: string;
  protocolVersion: string;
}
```

Every match and replay stores the complete `RuntimeVersionSet`.

## Deployment model
<!-- SECTION_REF: 01-system-architecture.s016 -->
Section Ref: `01-system-architecture.s016`

### Early stage
<!-- SECTION_REF: 01-system-architecture.s017 -->
Section Ref: `01-system-architecture.s017`

- One match-server instance.
- One API instance.
- Redis with persistence enabled.
- PostgreSQL.
- Frontend hosted separately.

### Later scaling
<!-- SECTION_REF: 01-system-architecture.s018 -->
Section Ref: `01-system-architecture.s018`

- Sticky WebSocket routing by match ID.
- Multiple match-server instances.
- Any instance can recover a match from Redis if the assigned instance dies.
- Dedicated worker for replay compression and moderation analysis.

## Observability baseline
<!-- SECTION_REF: 01-system-architecture.s019 -->
Section Ref: `01-system-architecture.s019`

Instrument from day one:

- Match started/completed/errored/abandoned counts.
- Action acceptance/rejection rate.
- Average action processing time.
- Effect queue length and max depth.
- Decision timeout rate.
- State serialized size.
- WebSocket connection/reconnect rate.
- Redis hit/miss rate for card data.
- Replay drift failures in CI.

Every log line inside a live match should include `matchId`, `stateSeq`, and `actionSeq` when available.

## Ownership model
<!-- SECTION_REF: 01-system-architecture.s020 -->
Section Ref: `01-system-architecture.s020`

In solo development, the package boundaries still matter because they constrain scope. When contributors join, assign owners by package.

| Package | Owner profile |
|---|---|
| `types` | Shared, reviewed by engine + server owners |
| `engine-core` | Rules-focused engineer |
| `effects` | Rules/card implementation engineer |
| `cards` | Backend/API integration engineer |
| `match-server` | Real-time backend engineer |
| `api` | Backend/product engineer |
| `client` | Frontend/game UI engineer |
| `bot` | Gameplay/AI engineer |

## Cross-package workflow
<!-- SECTION_REF: 01-system-architecture.s021 -->
Section Ref: `01-system-architecture.s021`

1. Shared type changes land first.
2. Engine changes include tests and replay hash updates.
3. Effect-definition changes include card tests.
4. Protocol changes include old/new compatibility notes.
5. Integration tests run across packages before merge.

Avoid single PRs that rewrite multiple boundaries unless they are mechanical migrations.

## Confirmed technology stack from the original plan
<!-- SECTION_REF: 01-system-architecture.s022 -->
Section Ref: `01-system-architecture.s022`

The original architecture included a concrete stack. This rebuilt spec keeps those choices visible while still allowing later replacement if testing proves a better option.

| Layer | Confirmed / initial choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Language | TypeScript full stack | Shared types across client, server, and engine. |
| Frontend | React | Large contributor pool, component ecosystem, Storybook support. |
| Board rendering | DOM + CSS + framer-motion | A card game is primarily a layout problem. Canvas/WebGL can be introduced later for specific needs. |
| API framework | Fastify | Pairs well with Zod schemas and TypeScript. |
| WebSocket | `ws` custom rooms or `socket.io` | Real-time match communication. |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Durable users, decks, matches, replays, ratings, social, moderation. |
| Cache / ephemeral state | Redis | Sessions, matchmaking queues, active match recovery, Poneglyph read-through cache. |
| Card data | Poneglyph API (`api.poneglyph.one`) | Source of truth for printed card text, stats, images, variants, and metadata. |
| Monorepo | Turborepo over pnpm workspaces | Lightweight task running and build caching. |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | Package-level PR checks and deployment workflows. |
| Backend hosting | Railway or Fly.io initially | Managed hosting with WebSocket support. |
| Frontend hosting | TBD | Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, or similar. |
| Observability | Structured logs plus Prometheus/Grafana or Datadog | Match ID should be the correlation key. |

## Poneglyph-centered card-data topology
<!-- SECTION_REF: 01-system-architecture.s023 -->
Section Ref: `01-system-architecture.s023`

Poneglyph is external display/metadata truth. The simulator is gameplay truth.

```text
Poneglyph API
  -> @optcg/cards fetches and validates with Zod
  -> Redis read-through cache stores validated Poneglyph metadata
  -> simulator overlay adds effect definitions, support status, rulings, banlist status
  -> match server snapshots resolved cards at match creation
  -> engine consumes the match card manifest and effect registry
```

Important boundaries:

- The match server never trusts Poneglyph data supplied by the client.
- The client may fetch Poneglyph data for images/search/display only.
- The server validates every Poneglyph response before use.
- Simulator overlays are keyed by Poneglyph card ID.
- Poneglyph variant indexes/generated variant keys are cosmetic and stored in deck data, not rule state.

## Original team and workflow rules preserved
<!-- SECTION_REF: 01-system-architecture.s024 -->
Section Ref: `01-system-architecture.s024`

Even during solo development, the original ownership model remains useful because it defines clean module boundaries.

| Module | Future owner profile | Depends on |
|---|---|---|
| `@optcg/types` | Shared / rotating | None |
| `@optcg/cards` | API integration developer | Poneglyph API, Redis |
| `@optcg/engine-core` | Rules engineer | `types`, card manifest |
| `@optcg/effects` | Rules/card implementation engineer | `types`, card schema |
| `@optcg/match-server` | Real-time backend engineer | `engine-core`, `types`, Redis |
| `@optcg/api` | Backend/product engineer | `types`, PostgreSQL, Redis |
| `@optcg/client` | Frontend/game UI engineer | `types`, `view-engine` |
| `@optcg/bot` | AI/gameplay developer | `engine-core` |

Workflow rules:

1. Avoid cross-module PRs. If a feature touches multiple packages, land shared type changes first, then package-specific PRs.
2. Module owners review their package's PRs once contributors join.
3. Integration tests live at the top level and exercise package boundaries.
4. `@optcg/types` and `@optcg/engine-core` are semantically versioned; consumers upgrade deliberately.
5. Changes to Poneglyph schema handling require card-data validation tests.
6. Changes to effect definitions require card tests and coverage updates.

## Deployment and scaling notes from the original plan
<!-- SECTION_REF: 01-system-architecture.s025 -->
Section Ref: `01-system-architecture.s025`

Early stage:

- Single match-server process is acceptable.
- Persist active match snapshots/actions to Redis anyway so deploys and crashes are recoverable.
- Use sticky WebSocket routing by `matchId` once multiple match-server instances exist.

Later stage:

- Store active match ownership in Redis.
- If a match-server instance dies, another instance can recover the match from Redis.
- Replay compression, moderation analysis, and card coverage checks can move to background workers.
