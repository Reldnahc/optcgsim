# ADR 0002: Split Server Engine from Client View Engine
<!-- SECTION_REF: 0002-client-view-engine-split.s001 -->
Section Ref: `0002-client-view-engine-split.s001`

## Status
<!-- SECTION_REF: 0002-client-view-engine-split.s002 -->
Section Ref: `0002-client-view-engine-split.s002`

Accepted.

## Context
<!-- SECTION_REF: 0002-client-view-engine-split.s003 -->
Section Ref: `0002-client-view-engine-split.s003`

The browser needs responsive UI and may benefit from prediction, but giving it full engine state would leak hidden information such as opponent hand contents, deck order, face-down life, RNG seed, and internal queue state.

## Decision
<!-- SECTION_REF: 0002-client-view-engine-split.s004 -->
Section Ref: `0002-client-view-engine-split.s004`

Use two layers:

- `@optcg/engine-core`: server-only, authoritative, full `GameState`.
- `@optcg/view-engine`: client-safe helpers that operate only on `PlayerView`.

## Consequences
<!-- SECTION_REF: 0002-client-view-engine-split.s005 -->
Section Ref: `0002-client-view-engine-split.s005`

Positive:

- Stronger hidden-information boundary.
- Easier security testing.
- Client code cannot accidentally depend on hidden fields.

Negative:

- Some logic is duplicated as UI affordance logic.
- Client prediction is less powerful.

## Implementation notes
<!-- SECTION_REF: 0002-client-view-engine-split.s006 -->
Section Ref: `0002-client-view-engine-split.s006`

The server may send legal action summaries to the client. The client should not derive authoritative legality from hidden state.
