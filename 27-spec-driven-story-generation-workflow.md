# Spec-Driven Story Generation Workflow
<!-- SECTION_REF: 27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s001 -->
Section Ref: `27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s001`

This document defines how the specification should be converted into epics, stories, and agent-ready packets.

The goal is to make the delivery workflow spec-driven instead of manager-memory-driven.

## Workflow summary
<!-- SECTION_REF: 27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s002 -->
Section Ref: `27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s002`

The required planning flow is:

1. specification documents,
2. candidate story generation,
3. story normalization,
4. story approval,
5. agent packet construction,
6. implementation or review agent execution,
7. validation against the approved story and cited spec.

The repo may automate some or all of these steps, but it must preserve the same authority order.

## Authority order
<!-- SECTION_REF: 27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s003 -->
Section Ref: `27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s003`

For planning and execution:

1. specification documents,
2. approved story,
3. agent packet,
4. implementation patch,
5. generated summaries or reports.

If a lower layer conflicts with a higher layer, the higher layer wins.

## Story generation inputs
<!-- SECTION_REF: 27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s004 -->
Section Ref: `27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s004`

At minimum, story generation should read:

- relevant spec markdown files,
- implementation-tightening notes,
- repo tooling requirements,
- code standards and architecture constraints,
- any contract files required by the section being converted.
- for platform and competitive stories, the game-type and format policy docs (`29-...` and `30-...`).

Story generation should prefer exact section references instead of vague file-level citations whenever practical.

## Story generation outputs
<!-- SECTION_REF: 27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s005 -->
Section Ref: `27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s005`

The generation step should produce:

- one or more epics for broad areas,
- candidate stories in the schema defined by [`24-story-schema.md`](24-story-schema.md),
- flagged ambiguities when the spec is not decisive,
- optional dependency suggestions.

Generated stories are not approved automatically unless the project explicitly adopts an automated approval rule. The default assumption is human approval.

## Story generation prompt contract
<!-- SECTION_REF: 27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s006 -->
Section Ref: `27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s006`

Use a prompt equivalent to the following when extracting candidate stories from one or more spec sections:

```text
Read the provided OPTCG simulator specification sections and extract implementation-ready backlog items.

Rules:
- The specification is authoritative.
- Do not invent features not supported by the text.
- Break work into small, reviewable stories that fit one main implementation unit.
- Use the canonical story schema.
- Include exact spec references whenever possible.
- Include explicit scope, non-scope, acceptance criteria, required tests, and dependencies.
- If the specification is ambiguous, create an ambiguity story or flag the ambiguity instead of silently assuming behavior.
- Prefer fail_and_escalate for gameplay, hidden-information, replay, fairness, timer, and persistence behavior.
- Output only valid YAML objects matching the schema.
```

## Story normalization rules
<!-- SECTION_REF: 27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s007 -->
Section Ref: `27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s007`

After candidate generation, normalize stories before approval.

Normalization should:

- split oversized stories,
- merge duplicate stories,
- remove uncited invented behavior,
- align type and area labels,
- ensure required fields are present,
- ensure acceptance criteria are behavioral,
- ensure tests are specific,
- ensure ambiguity policy is appropriate for risk level.

A story that cannot be normalized cleanly should be converted into an ambiguity story or rejected.

## Approval rules
<!-- SECTION_REF: 27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s008 -->
Section Ref: `27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s008`

A story may move from `generated` to `approved` only if:

- required schema fields are present,
- spec references are valid,
- scope and non-scope are explicit,
- required tests exist,
- dependencies are reasonable,
- ambiguity policy is acceptable for the risk category.

## Agent packet generation
<!-- SECTION_REF: 27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s009 -->
Section Ref: `27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s009`

Once a story is approved, generate a packet using [`26-agent-packet-template.md`](26-agent-packet-template.md).

Packet generation should gather:

- the approved story,
- relevant spec excerpts,
- applicable repo rules,
- applicable architecture/code constraints,
- any directly related contract snippets needed for the task.

The packet should be minimal but sufficient. Overloading agents with the full spec is discouraged unless the task genuinely requires it.

## Suggested repo layout
<!-- SECTION_REF: 27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s010 -->
Section Ref: `27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s010`

A recommended structure is:

```text
/spec/
/stories/generated/
/stories/approved/
/stories/blocked/
/stories/done/
/stories/ambiguities/
/agent-packets/
/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
/.agents/skills/
/AGENTS.md
/tools/generate-stories.ts
/tools/normalize-stories.ts
/tools/build-agent-packet.ts
/tools/spec_board_sync.ts
/tools/github-board.config.example.json
/tools/trace-spec-impact.ts
```

The exact paths may differ, but the concepts should remain recognizable.

## Recommended automation layers
<!-- SECTION_REF: 27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s011 -->
Section Ref: `27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s011`

### Minimum viable process
<!-- SECTION_REF: 27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s012 -->
Section Ref: `27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s012`

1. use an agent or script to generate candidate stories from spec sections,
2. review and approve them,
3. build packets automatically,
4. assign packets to agents,
5. export approved stories to GitHub issues or draft issues as needed using `tools/spec_board_sync.ts`,
6. assign packets to agents,
7. validate the resulting patch against the story and spec.

### Stronger process
<!-- SECTION_REF: 27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s013 -->
Section Ref: `27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s013`

Add:

- dependency graphing,
- impacted-story detection when spec files change,
- schema validation for story files,
- review-agent checks for scope creep and uncited behavior,
- automatic movement between `generated`, `approved`, `blocked`, and `done` states,
- metadata writeback for synced GitHub issues and project items under `stories/.sync/`.

## Spec change impact tracing
<!-- SECTION_REF: 27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s014 -->
Section Ref: `27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s014`

Because stories cite spec sections, a later tooling step should be able to detect which approved or completed stories may be stale when a cited spec section changes.

Required principle:

- if a spec section changes materially, stories that cite it should be reviewed for drift.

## Recommended completion checks for story-driven implementation
<!-- SECTION_REF: 27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s015 -->
Section Ref: `27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s015`

A story should not be marked done unless:

- code behavior matches the cited spec,
- required tests are present and pass,
- repo verification passes,
- no prohibited scope creep is introduced,
- any new ambiguity is surfaced explicitly.

## First practical adoption step
<!-- SECTION_REF: 27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s016 -->
Section Ref: `27-spec-driven-story-generation-workflow.s016`

Before broad agent assignment begins, generate the first approved backlog from:

- `15-implementation-kickoff.md`,
- `22-v6-implementation-tightening.md`,
- `23-repo-tooling-and-enforcement.md`,
- `29-game-types-queues-and-lobbies.md`,
- `30-formats-and-ranked-competition.md`,
- the core engine, visibility, replay, and server sections.

That initial backlog should cover tooling, contracts, engine state, visibility safety, replay contracts, protocol foundation, and the platform/competitive scaffolding for queues, lobbies, formats, ladders, and disconnect discipline before large-scale feature work is assigned.
